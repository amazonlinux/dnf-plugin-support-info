## Amazon Linux 2022: DNF SupportInfo Pugin

Amazon Linux provides updates for all packages and maintains compatibility within a major version for customer applications that are built on Amazon Linux. Core packages, such as glibc, openssl, openssh, and the dnf package manager, receive support for the lifetime of the major Amazon Linux 2022 release. Packages that aren't part of the core packages receive support defined by their upstream sources.

In Amazon Linux 2022, you can see specific support status and dates of individual packages using the `dnf-plugin-support-info` plugin. You can even get information on all currently installed packages or apply filters based on "supported" or "unsupported" packages.

More information as to the maintenance support period of Amazon Linux 2022 can be found at [amazon-linux-2022/al2022-support-statements](https://github.com/amazonlinux/amazon-linux-2022/tree/main/al2022-support-statements).

The full list of core packages will be Ô¨Ånalized during the preview. If you want to see more packages included as core packages, tell us. We will evaluate as we are collecting feedback. Feedback on Amazon Linux 2022 can be provided through your designated AWS representative or [Amazon Linux Discussion Forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=228).

## Schema for support_info.xml file:

Amazon Linux developed an internal tooling which uses `repoquery` to generate the `support_info.xml` file. The elements of that XML file are defined by an XSD schema, file has been added under `configurations/` dir, and it can be tested with the `make` command when the Makefile has -

```

SUPPORT_INFO_SCHEMA = configuration/support_info.xsd
SUPPORT_INFO_FILE = support_info.xml

test: lint
lint: $(SUPPORT_INFO_SCHEMA) $(SUPPORT_INFO_FILE)
        xmllint --noout --schema $(SUPPORT_INFO_SCHEMA) $(SUPPORT_INFO_FILE)

```

## Plugin Usage:
